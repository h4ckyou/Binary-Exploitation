**File Checks:-**

The zip file attached to this challenge contained this files (excluding *solve.py*)

The only thing we would look at is the binary and shared object library file

Decompiling the binary in Ghidra and here's the main function

Nothing interesting except it calling the `pwnme()` function

Another obious buffer overflow here cause it's reading at most 512 bytes into a buffer that can only hold up 32 bytes

Looking through the available functions I saw this

At first this looks like our goal right? To call this function!

Looking at the decompilation we know that it would call `callme_three()` first

If you try to decompile it you get this

WTF is this? 

Looking at the assembly equivalent should give this

It's calling that function from an external source that's what it means

Basically that function was imported from the `shared object library file` libcallme.so

And the plt is used to resolve function addresses in imported libraries at runtime
