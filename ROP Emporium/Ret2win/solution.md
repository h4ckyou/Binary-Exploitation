This is the beginning of the ROP Emporium series and I'll be dealing with just the x64 architecture for now

##### File Checks:-

First thing first is always knowing what type of file you are working with and the protections enabled on it

Cool we are dealing with a 64 bits executable which is dynamically linked and not stripped

What does it mean for a binary to be dynamically linked? I can't explain that here but feel free to read [this](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/static-dynamic-linking-differences)

The result from running **checksec** gives this:
- Arch:     amd64-64-little
- RELRO:    Partial RELRO
- Stack:    No canary found
- NX:       NX enabled
- PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)

Here are what each protection does:
- **RELRO (Relocation Read-Only)** is enabled to be **FULL** that basically makes the **GOT** read only so we can't overwrite the **GOT** but in this cause it's **PARTIAL** which makes **GOT** overwrite possible.
- **Stack** in this case shows that there are no canaries which makes exploiting buffer overflow possible but if they were canary enabled we would need to find a way to leak it as it would make exploiting a  buffer overflow hard.
- **NX (No Execute)** in this case shows that it's enabled which means we can't put shellcode on the stack and execute it.
- **PIE (Position Independent Executable)** in this case is not enabled which makes the binary memory address the same on each execution.
