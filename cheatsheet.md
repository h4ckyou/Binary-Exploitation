### CheatSheet For Binary Exploitation

To debug a binary on gdb-gef

```
gdb -q ./bofme --> runs the binary and supress the output

info functions --> lists functions in the binary

break main --> sets a breakpoint in main

nexti --> will have you go instruction by intruction through the program, but will not step into function calls such as puts

next --> which will take you through one line of code, but will step over function calls such as puts

step --> which will take you through one line of code, but will step into function calls

stepi --> whch will take you through one instruction at a time, stepping into function calls

disassemble --> disassembles a function when specified

info breakpoint --> shows the list of breakpoint set

delete <num> --> deletes a breakpoint where <num> is the breakpoint number

p $eip --> prints the address for eip register

info registers --> shows all the content of the registers

info frame --> shows the stack frame

set {char [12]} 0x080484b0 = "pwner" --> this sets the address specified to the value pwner

set *0x08048451 = 0xdeadbeef --> sets the address specified to 0xdeadbeef

j *0x08048451 --> this directly jumps to the memory address
