### Intro

Trying to learn binary exploitation / Reverse Engineering

It's gonna be a long race but I hope I finish it off 

### Binary Exploitation

First off what's a binary?

A binary is compiled code. When a programmer writes code in a language like C, the C code isn't what gets actually ran.
It is compiled into a binary file and the binary is run. 
Binary exploitation is the process of actually exploiting a binary, but what does that mean?
In a lot of code, you will find bugs. Think of a bug as a mistake in code that will allow for unintended functionality.
As an attacker we can leverage this bug to attack the binary, and actually force it to do what we want by getting code execution. 
That means we actually have the binary execute whatever code that we want, and can essentially hack the code.

### Reverse Engineering

What is reverse engineering?

Reverse engineering is the process of figuring out how something works. 
It is a critical part of binary exploitation, since most of the time you are just handed a binary without any clue as to what it does. 
You have to figure out how it works, so you can attack it.

### Objective

Most of the time, your objective is to obtain code execution on a box and pop a root shell. 
If you have a different objective, it will usually be stated on the top line of the writeup.
In almost every instance where your objective isn't to pop a shell, it's to get a CTF flag associated with this challenge, from the binary.

### Difficulty Curve

One more thing I want to say is the difficulty curve, in my opinion, is like that of a roller coaster.
There are certain parts that are easier, and certain parts that are harder. Granted, difficulty is relative to the person.
